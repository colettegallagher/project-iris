### 1. History
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistican and geneticist.

Fisher introduced the Iris Flower Data Set in his 1936 paper.  The data set consists of three species of Iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Virginica
3. Iris Versicolor

Fifty samples of each of the three species were measured.  Each sample was measured in centimetres and recorded into four categories:
1. Length of the Sepals
2. Width of the Sepals
3. Length of the Petals
4. Width of the Petals

Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish each of the iris species from each other.
