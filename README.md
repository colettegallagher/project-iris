### 1. History
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistican and geneticist.

Fisher introduced the Iris Flower Data Set in his 1936 paper.  The data set consists of three species of Iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Virginica
3. Iris Versicolor

Fifty samples of each of the three species were measured.  Each of the 150 samples were measured, in centimetres, and recorded in five categories:
1. Length of the Sepals
2. Width of the Sepals
3. Length of the Petals
4. Width of the Petals
5. Class

Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish each of the iris species from each other.
