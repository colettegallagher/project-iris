### 1. History
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistican and geneticist.

Fisher introduced the Iris Flower Data Set in his 1936 paper.  The data set consists of three species of Iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Virginica
3. Iris Versicolor

Fifty samples of each of the three species were measured.  Each of the 150 samples were measured, in centimetres, and recorded in five categories:
1. Length of the Sepals
2. Width of the Sepals
3. Length of the Petals
4. Width of the Petals
5. Class

Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish each of the iris species from each other.

### 2. How to Run the required Codes in this Repository
The codes in this repository were created in visual studio code using ipython

Visual Studio Code can be downloaded by using the below link

IPython is the programme used in Visual Studio Code.  NumPy is the library used by IPython.

### 3. Statistics Used
Min  Max   Mean    SD   Class Correlation
Class Distribution: 33.3% for each of 3 classes.

SD: To calculate the standard deviation of those numbers:
Work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers)
Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result.
Then work out the mean of those squared differences.
Take the square root of that and we are done!

Class Correlation (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/57776/what-is-class-correlation)
